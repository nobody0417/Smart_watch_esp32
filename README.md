# Smart_watch_esp32
Just a basic version os smart watch uses ntp client to connect to time, if connected to battery will retain time, included icons for wether but one must include their own api to get details, In future may be make an app to send and receive data


make sure to run smartwatch.ino file as main file for compiling and 
keep remaining files in same folder
